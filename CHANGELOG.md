* This is a simple and lightweight ViewModel designed specifically for Flutter. It doesn't rely on
  any complex mechanisms.
  Instead, it's implemented solely based on StreamController and setState.
  Although it triggers setState for the entire Widget tree, there's no need to worry about this.
  This is because the Widget tree essentially serves as a configuration, incurring minimal
  performance overhead.
