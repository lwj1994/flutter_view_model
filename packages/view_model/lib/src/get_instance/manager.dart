/// This singleton class manages the creation, caching, and disposal of ViewModel
/// instances across the application. It maintains separate stores for each
/// ViewModel type and handles watcher relationships.
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - ViewModel instance creation and caching
/// - Watcher registration and management
/// - Instance recreation and cleanup
/// - Type-safe instance retrieval
///
/// The manager uses a store-per-type architecture where each ViewModel type
/// has its own dedicated store for managing instances of that type.

  /// This method forces the recreation of a ViewModel instance, optionally
  /// using a custom builder function. The new instance will replace the
  /// existing one in the store.

  /// - [t]: The existing instance to recreate
  /// - [builder]: Optional custom builder function for the new instance
  ///
